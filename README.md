# CATAM
Python, Self-consistent gravitating system
Catam Project 23.1

It needs numpy and matplotlib to run.
All the graphing / data analysis bits are commented out in different chunks - uncomment one and run it, otherwise only the realisation will be created and nothing will show

Mathematically speaking, the code takes a random (radius, velocity) pair and compares f(e)r^2 v^2 vs a random value (Monte Carlo method). It then decides whether to accept it or not. This leads to a numerical realisation of the distribution function.
