Python, Self-consistent gravitating system
Catam Project 23.1

all the graphing / data analysis bits are commented out in different chunks - uncomment one and run it

mathematically speaking - takes a random radius, velocity pair, compares f(e)r^2 v^2 vs a random value (Monte Carlo method), decides whether to accept or not
numerical realisation of the disrtibution function
